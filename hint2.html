           <b> Machine and assembly languages</b>

            A <a href="not.html">machine language</a> consists of the numeric codes for the operations that a particular computer can execute directly. The
            codes are strings of 0s and 1s, or binary digits (“bits”), which are frequently converted both from and to hexadecimal
            (base 16) for human viewing and modification. Machine language instructions typically use some bits to represent
            operations, such as addition, and some to represent operands, or perhaps the location of the next instruction. Machine
            language is difficult to read and write, since it does not resemble conventional mathematical notation or human
            language, and its codes vary from computer to computer.
            
            <a href="not.html">Assembly language</a> is one level above machine language. It uses short mnemonic codes for instructions and allows the
            programmer to introduce names for blocks of memory that hold data. One might thus write “add pay, total” instead of
            “0110101100101000” for an instruction that adds two numbers.
            Assembly language is designed to be easily translated into machine language. Although blocks of data may be referred to
            by name instead of by their machine addresses, assembly language does not provide more sophisticated means of organizing
            complex information. Like machine language, assembly language requires detailed knowledge of internal computer
            architecture. It is useful when such details are important, as in programming a computer to interact with peripheral
            devices (printers, scanners, storage devices, and so forth).

            <b>FORTRAN</b>

            The first important algorithmic language was <a href="not.html">FORTRAN</a> (formula translation), designed in 1957 by an IBM team led by John
            Backus. It was intended for scientific computations with real numbers and collections of them organized as one- or
            multidimensional arrays. Its control structures included conditional IF statements, repetitive loops (so-called DO
            loops), and a GOTO statement that allowed nonsequential execution of program code. FORTRAN made it convenient to have
            subprograms for common mathematical operations, and built libraries of them.
            
            FORTRAN was also designed to translate into efficient machine language. It was immediately successful and continues to
            evolve
        </pre>
        <pre class="p">
            <b>ALGOL</b>

            <a href="not.html">ALGOL</a> (algorithmic language) was designed by a committee of American and European computer scientists during 1958–60 for
            publishing algorithms, as well as for doing computations. Like LISP (described in the next section), ALGOL had recursive
            subprograms—procedures that could invoke themselves to solve a problem by reducing it to a smaller problem of the same
            kind. ALGOL introduced block structure, in which a program is composed of blocks that might contain both data and
            instructions and have the same structure as an entire program. Block structure became a powerful tool for building large
            programs out of small components.
            
            ALGOL contributed a notation for describing the structure of a programming language, Backus–Naur Form, which in some
            variation became the standard tool for stating the syntax (grammar) of programming languages. ALGOL was widely used in
            Europe, and for many years it remained the language in which computer algorithms were published. Many important
            languages, such as Pascal and Ada (both described later), are its descendants.
        </pre>
        <pre class="p">
            <b>C</b>

            The <a href="not.html">C</a> programming language was developed in 1972 by Dennis Ritchie and Brian Kernighan at the AT&T Corporation for
            programming computer operating systems. Its capacity to structure data and programs through the composition of smaller
            units is comparable to that of ALGOL. It uses a compact notation and provides the programmer with the ability to operate
            with the addresses of data as well as with their values. This ability is important in systems programming, and C shares
            with assembly language the power to exploit all the features of a computer’s internal architecture. C, along with its
            descendant C++, remains one of the most common languages.
        </pre>
        <pre class="p">
            <b>COBOL</b>

            <a href="not.html">COBOL</a> (common business oriented language) has been heavily used by businesses since its inception in 1959. A committee
            of computer manufacturers and users and U.S. government organizations established CODASYL (Committee on Data Systems and
            Languages) to develop and oversee the language standard in order to ensure its portability across diverse systems.
            
            COBOL uses an English-like notation—novel when introduced. Business computations organize and manipulate large
            quantities of data, and COBOL introduced the record data structure for such tasks. A record clusters heterogeneous
            data—such as a name, an ID number, an age, and an address—into a single unit. This contrasts with scientific languages,
            in which homogeneous arrays of numbers are common. Records are an important example of “chunking” data into a single
            object, and they appear in nearly all modern languages.
            
            <b>SQL</b>

            <a href="not.html">SQL</a> (structured query language) is a language for specifying the organization of databases (collections of records).
            Databases organized with SQL are called relational, because SQL provides the ability to query a database for information
            that falls in a given relation. For example, a query might be “find all records with both last name Smith and city New
            York.” Commercial database programs commonly use an SQL-like language for their queries.
            
            <b>Education-oriented languages

            BASIC</b>

            BASIC (beginner’s all-purpose symbolic instruction code) was designed at Dartmouth College in the mid-1960s by John
            Kemeny and Thomas Kurtz. It was intended to be easy to learn by novices, particularly non-computer science majors, and
            to run well on a time-sharing computer with many users. It had simple data structures and notation and it was
            interpreted: a BASIC program was translated line-by-line and executed as it was translated, which made it easy to locate
            programming errors.
            
            Its small size and simplicity also made BASIC a popular language for early personal computers. Its recent forms have
            adopted many of the data and control structures of other contemporary languages, which makes it more powerful but less
            convenient for beginners.
            
            <b>Pascal</b>

            About 1970 Niklaus Wirth of Switzerland designed <a href="not.html">Pascal</a> to teach structured programming, which emphasized the orderly
            use of conditional and loop control structures without GOTO statements. Although Pascal resembled ALGOL in notation, it
            provided the ability to define data types with which to organize complex information, a feature beyond the capabilities
            of ALGOL as well as FORTRAN and COBOL. User-defined data types allowed the programmer to introduce names for complex
            data, which the language translator could then check for correct usage before running a program.
            
            During the late 1970s and ’80s, Pascal was one of the most widely used languages for programming instruction. It was
            available on nearly all computers, and, because of its familiarity, clarity, and security, it was used for production
            software as well as for education.
            
            <b>Logo</b>

            <a href="not.html">Logo </a> originated in the late 1960s as a simplified LISP dialect for education; Seymour Papert and others used it at MIT
            to teach mathematical thinking to schoolchildren. It had a more conventional syntax than LISP and featured “turtle
            graphics,” a simple method for generating computer graphics. (The name came from an early project to program a
            turtlelike robot.) Turtle graphics used body-centred instructions, in which an object was moved around a screen by
            commands, such as “left 90” and “forward,” that specified actions relative to the current position and orientation of
            the object rather than in terms of a fixed framework. Together with recursive routines, this technique made it easy to
            program intricate and attractive patterns.
            
            <b>Hypertalk</b>

            <a href="not.html">Hypertalk</a> was designed as “programming for the rest of us” by Bill Atkinson for Apple’s Macintosh. Using a simple
            English-like syntax, Hypertalk enabled anyone to combine text, graphics, and audio quickly into “linked stacks” that
            could be navigated by clicking with a mouse on standard buttons supplied by the program. Hypertalk was particularly
            popular among educators in the 1980s and early ’90s for classroom multimedia presentations. Although Hypertalk had many
            features of object-oriented languages (described in the next section), Apple did not develop it for other computer
            platforms and let it languish; as Apple’s market share declined in the 1990s, a new cross-platform way of displaying
            multimedia left Hypertalk all but obsolete (see the section World Wide Web display languages).
            
            <b>Object-oriented languages</b>

            <a href="not.html">Object-oriented languages</a> help to manage complexity in large programs. Objects package data and the operations on them
            so that only the operations are publicly accessible and internal details of the data structures are hidden. This
            information hiding made large-scale programming easier by allowing a programmer to think about each part of the program
            in isolation. In addition, objects may be derived from more general ones, “inheriting” their capabilities. Such an
            object hierarchy made it possible to define specialized objects without repeating all that is in the more general ones.
            
            Object-oriented programming began with the Simula language (1967), which added information hiding to ALGOL. Another
            influential object-oriented language was Smalltalk (1980), in which a program was a set of objects that interacted by
            sending messages to one another.
            
            <b>C++</b>

            The <a href="not.html">C++</a> language, developed by Bjarne Stroustrup at AT&T in the mid-1980s, extended C by adding objects to it while
            preserving the efficiency of C programs. It has been one of the most important languages for both education and
            industrial programming. Large parts of many operating systems were written in C++. C++, along with Java, has become
            popular for developing commercial software packages that incorporate multiple interrelated applications. C++ is
            considered one of the fastest languages and is very close to low-level languages, thus allowing complete control over
            memory allocation and management. This very feature and its many other capabilities also make it one of the most
            difficult languages to learn and handle on a large scale.
            
            <b>C#</b>

            <a href="not.html">C#</a> (pronounced C sharp like the musical note) was developed by Anders Hejlsberg at Microsoft in 2000. C# has a syntax
            similar to that of C and C++ and is often used for developing games and applications for the Microsoft Windows operating
            system.
            
            <b>Ada</b>

            <a href="not.html">Ada</a> was named for Augusta Ada King, countess of Lovelace, who was an assistant to the 19th-century English inventor
            Charles Babbage, and is sometimes called the first computer programmer. Ada, the language, was developed in the early
            1980s for the U.S. Department of Defense for large-scale programming. It combined Pascal-like notation with the ability
            to package operations and data into independent modules. Its first form, Ada 83, was not fully object-oriented, but the
            subsequent Ada 95 provided objects and the ability to construct hierarchies of them. While no longer mandated for use in
            work for the Department of Defense, Ada remains an effective language for engineering large programs.
            
            <b>Java</b>

            In the early 1990s <a href="not.html">Java</a> was designed by Sun Microsystems, Inc., as a programming language for the World Wide Web (WWW).
            Although itresembled C++ in appearance, it was object-oriented. In particular, Java dispensed with lower-level
            features, including the ability to manipulate data addresses, a capability that is neither desirable nor useful in
            programs for distributed systems. In order to be portable, Java programs are translated by a Java Virtual Machine
            specific to each computer platform, which then executes the Java program. In addition to adding interactive capabilities
            to the Internet through Web “applets,” Java has been widely used for programming small and portable devices, such as
            mobile telephones.
            
            <b>Visual Basic</b>

            <a href="not.html">Visual Basic</a> was developed by Microsoft to extend the capabilities of BASIC by adding objects and “event-driven”
            programming: buttons, menus, and other elements of graphical user interfaces (GUIs). Visual Basic can also be used
            within other Microsoft software to program small routines. Visual Basic was succeeded in 2002 by Visual Basic .NET, a
            vastly different language based on C#, a language with similarities to C++.
            
            <b>Python</b>
            The open-source language <a href="not.html">Python</a> was developed by Dutch programmer Guido van Rossum in 1991. It was designed as an
            easy-to-use language, with features such as using indentation instead of brackets to group statements. Python is also a
            very compact language, designed so that complex jobs can be executed with only a few statements. In the 2010s, Python
            became one of the most popular programming languages, along with Java and JavaScript.
            
            <b>Declarative languages</b>

            <a href="not.html">Declarative languages</a>, also called nonprocedural or very high level, are programming languages in which (ideally) a
            program specifies what is to be done rather than how to do it. In such languages there is less difference between the
            specification of a program and its implementation than in the procedural languages described so far. The two common
            kinds of declarative languages are logic and functional languages.
            
            <b>Pseudocode</b> 

            In computer science, <a href="hint3.html">pseudocode</a> is a plain language description of the steps in an algorithm or another system.
            Pseudocode often uses structural conventions of a normal programming language, but is intended for human reading rather
            than machine reading.

            Logic programming languages, of which PROLOG (programming in logic) is the best known, state a program as a set of
            logical relations (e.g., a grandparent is the parent of a parent of someone). Such languages are similar to the SQL
            database language. A program is executed by an “inference engine” that answers a query by searching these relations
            systematically to make inferences that will answer a query. PROLOG has been used extensively in natural language
            processing and other AI programs.
            Functional languages have a mathematical style. A functional program is constructed by applying functions to arguments.
            Functional languages, such as LISP, ML, and Haskell, are used as research tools in language development, in automated
            mathematical theorem provers, and in some commercial projects.
            
            <b>Scripting languages</b>

            <a href="not.html">Scripting languages</a> are sometimes called little languages. They are intended to solve relatively small programming
            problems that do not require the overhead of data declarations and other features needed to make large programs
            manageable. Scripting languages are used for writing operating system utilities, for special-purpose file-manipulation
            programs, and, because they are easy to learn, sometimes for considerably larger programs.
            
            <a href="not.html">Perl</a> was developed in the late 1980s, originally for use with the UNIX operating system. It was intended to have all the
            capabilities of earlier scripting languages. Perl provided many ways to state common operations and thereby allowed a
            programmer to adopt any convenient style. In the 1990s it became popular as a system-programming tool, both for small
            utility programs and for prototypes of larger ones. Together with other languages discussed below, it also became
            popular for programming computer Web “servers.”
            
            <b>Document formatting languages</b>

            <a href="not.html">Document formatting languages</a>
            Document formatting languages specify the organization of printed text and graphics. They fall into several classes:
            text formatting notation that can serve the same functions as a word processing program, page description languages that
            are interpreted by a printing device, and, most generally, markup languages that describe the intended function of
            portions of a document.
            
            <b>TeX</b>

            <a href="not.html">TeX</a> was developed during 1977–86 as a text formatting language by Donald Knuth, a Stanford University professor, to
            improve the quality of mathematical notation in his books. Text formatting systems, unlike WYSIWYG (“What You See Is
            What You Get”) word processors, embed plain text formatting commands in a document, which are then interpreted by the
            language processor to produce a formatted document for display or printing. TeX marks italic text, for example, as {\it
            this is italicized}, which is then displayed as this is italicized.
            
            TeX largely replaced earlier text formatting languages. Its powerful and flexible abilities gave an expert precise
            control over such things as the choice of fonts, layout of tables, mathematical notation, and the inclusion of graphics
            within a document. It is generally used with the aid of “macro” packages that define simple commands for common
            operations, such as starting a new paragraph; LaTeX is a widely used package. TeX contains numerous standard “style
            sheets” for different types of documents, and these may be further adapted by each user. There are also related programs
            such as BibTeX, which manages bibliographies and has style sheets for all of the common bibliography styles, and
            versions of TeX for languages with various alphabets.
            
            <b>PostScript</b>

            <a href="not.html">PostScript</a> is a page-description language developed in the early 1980s by Adobe Systems Incorporated on the basis of
            work at Xerox PARC (Palo Alto Research Center). Such languages describe documents in terms that can be interpreted by a
            personal computer to display the document on its screen or by a microprocessor in a printer or a typesetting device.
            
            PostScript commands can, for example, precisely position text, in various fonts and sizes, draw images that are
            mathematically described, and specify colour or shading. PostScript uses postfix, also called reverse Polish notation,
            in which an operation name follows its arguments. Thus, “300 600 20 270 arc stroke” means: draw (“stroke”) a 270-degree
            arc with radius 20 at location (300, 600). Although PostScript can be read and written by a programmer, it is normally
            produced by text formatting programs, word processors, or graphic display tools.
            
            The success of PostScript is due to its specification’s being in the public domain and to its being a good match for
            high-resolution laser printers. It has influenced the development of printing fonts, and manufacturers produce a large
            variety of PostScript fonts.
            
            <b>SGML</b>

            <a href="not.html">SGML</a> (standard generalized markup language) is an international standard for the definition of markup languages; that
            is, it is a metalanguage. Markup consists of notations called tags that specify the function of a piece of text or how
            it is to be displayed. SGML emphasizes descriptive markup, in which a tag might be “<emphasis>.” Such a markup denotes
            the document function, and it could be interpreted as reverse video on a computer screen, underlining by a
            typewriter, or italics in typeset text.
            
            SGML is used to specify DTDs (document type definitions). A DTD defines a kind of document, such as a report, by
            specifying what elements must appear in the document—e.g., <Title>—and giving rules for the use of document
            elements, such as that a paragraph may appear within a table entry but a table may not appear within a
            paragraph. A marked-up text may be analyzed by a parsing program to determine if it conforms to a DTD. Another
            program may read the markups to prepare an index or to translate the document into PostScript for printing. Yet
            another might generate large type or audio for readers with visual or hearing disabilities.

            The World Wide Web is a system for displaying text, graphics, and audio retrieved over the Internet on a
            computer monitor. Each retrieval unit is known as a Web page, and such pages frequently contain “links” that
            allow related pages to be retrieved. <a href="not.html">HTML</a> (hypertext markup language) is the markup language for encoding Web
            pages. It was designed by Tim Berners-Lee at the CERN nuclear physics laboratory in Switzerland during the 1980s
            and is defined by an SGML DTD. HTML markup tags specify document elements such as headings, paragraphs, and
            tables. They mark up a document for display by a computer program known as a Web browser. The browser interprets
            the tags, displaying the headings, paragraphs, and tables in a layout that is adapted to the screen size and
            fonts available to it.
            
            HTML documents also contain anchors, which are tags that specify links to other Web pages. An anchor has the
            form  Encyclopædia Britannica, where the quoted string is the URL
            (uniform resource locator) to which the link points (the Web “address”) and the text following it is what
            appears in a Web browser, underlined to show that it is a link to another page. What is displayed as a single
            page may also be formed from multiple URLs, some containing text and others graphics.
